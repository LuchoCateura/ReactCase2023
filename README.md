This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

In order to run the project locally, don't forget to install all the dependencies and update the `.env` file with the correct parameters.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `Improvements`

Improvements that I could have made with more time:

- Use state management library - e.g. Redux
- Use pagination library
- Implement TypeScript
- Implement Chakra UI theme extension
- Improve data fetching reusability
- Use vite instead of webpack
- Improve requests performance
- Host this demo app in a cloud provider
- Notifications to users after post creation
